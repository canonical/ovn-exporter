Contributor requirements
------------------------

Before contributing to this project, you must sign the `Canonical contributor
license agreement`_. Signing this agreement grants Canonical permission to
distribute your work under the project license, while you retain copyright to
your contribution.

To accept the agreement, please follow these guidelines:

* Commits must be logical units. Each commit should pass all tests.
* Commits must be signed, including the ``Signed-off-by`` header.
* Commit messages should focus on **why** things are being changed, not only on
  what is being changed. The commit message title should be a short summary of
  the commit, while the body should (if relevant) provide more detail. For
  example, explaining the reason why a particular implementation was chosen.
